      This is YAMAMOTO Mitsuharu's "Mac port" addition to
      GNU Emacs. This provides a native GUI support for Mac OS X.
      After installing, see README-mac and NEWS-mac
      in #{prefix} for the port details.

      Emacs.app was installed to:
        #{prefix}

      To link the application to default Homebrew App location:
        ln -s #{prefix}/Emacs.app /Applications
      Other ways please refer:
        https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport/wiki/Alternative-way-of-place-Emacs.app-to-Applications-directory

      For an Emacs.app CLI starter, see:
        https://gist.github.com/4043945
